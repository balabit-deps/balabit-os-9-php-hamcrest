 Hamcrest is a matching library originally written for Java, but subsequently
 ported to many other languages. hamcrest-php is the official PHP port of
 Hamcrest and essentially follows a literal translation of the original Java
 API for Hamcrest, with a few Exceptions, mostly down to PHP language barriers.
